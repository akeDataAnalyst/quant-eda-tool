Project 3: Internal Quant Tool for Exploratory Data Analysis

Description

An interactive utility that allows quants to upload datasets, perform ad-hoc explorations (e.g., correlations, distributions), and automate basic preprocessing—designed for a research-driven environment to streamline data prep without engineering overhead.
Problem and Solution
Problem: Quants in trading firms often face unstructured datasets from diverse sources, requiring manual exploration that slows down hypothesis testing in a competitive market where rapid iteration is key.

Solution: Create a self-service tool for quick insights and automation, cutting exploration time by  70% through predefined analyses, fostering efficient support for ad-hoc research tasks in a stable workflow.Stacks to UsePython (scripting and utilities)
Pandas (data exploration and manipulation)
NumPy (array-based computations for stats)
Streamlit (web app for user interaction and visualizations)

Phase-by-Phase Implementation
Project Initialization: Install libraries. Source datasets like public financial time-series from Quandl or Kaggle (e.g., "Cryptocurrency Historical Prices"). Prepare sample CSVs with mixed data types.
Data Ingestion and Basic Checks: Script to load via Pandas read_csv(). 
Run quality checks: data types, unique values (df.nunique()), and missing data summaries.
Exploratory Analysis Functions: Build modular functions—correlations with Pandas corr() and NumPy for matrix ops; distributions via histograms (np.histogram). Compute advanced stats like skewness (scipy.stats.skew if needed, but stick to NumPy).
Automation Utilities: Add one-click features: Normalize columns (df.apply(lambda x: (x - np.mean(x)) / np.std(x))), groupby aggregations. Ensure outputs are exportable.
Streamlit App Assembly: Develop UI with file upload, sidebar options for analysis types (e.g., checkboxes for correlations). Render results dynamically: st.dataframe for tables, st.pyplot for NumPy-based plots integrated with Matplotlib.
Validation and Refinement: Edge-case testing (e.g., non-numeric data). Profile for efficiency on large sets. Add documentation in code and a GitHub README with usage examples.
Alignment to Eqvilent Needs: Focus on intellectual tasks like signal exploration (e.g., rolling correlations for market regimes). Highlight collaboration by making the tool shareable for quant-engineer workflows.
