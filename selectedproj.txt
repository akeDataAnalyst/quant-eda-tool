Internal Quant Tool for Exploratory Data Analysis | Python, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit
Built a self-service interactive utility enabling quantitative researchers to upload datasets, conduct rapid ad-hoc explorations, and automate preprocessing tasks in a research-driven environment.
• Implemented comprehensive data ingestion, quality checks (missing values, data types, uniqueness), and modular exploratory functions using Pandas and NumPy, including correlations, distributions, skewness, and rolling statistics for financial time-series analysis.
• Developed one-click automation features for normalization, group-by aggregations, and exportable results, reducing manual data preparation time and supporting faster hypothesis testing in competitive quant workflows.
• Created an intuitive Streamlit web application with file upload, dynamic sidebar controls for analysis selection, real-time tables, and interactive visualizations—facilitating efficient ad-hoc research and seamless collaboration with quants and engineers.
