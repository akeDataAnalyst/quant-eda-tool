# Quant EDA Tool – Internal Exploratory Data Analysis Utility

**A professional, interactive Streamlit tool designed to support quantitative researchers and analysts in data-rich environments.**

## Overview

This project is a **self-contained internal utility** built to streamline the workflow of quantitative researchers working with high-frequency market or tick data. It automates the most common pain points when handling raw datasets:

- **Data quality validation** (duplicates, missing values, negative prices, outliers, zero volumes)
- **One-click cleaning** (deduplication, outlier/negative fixing, forward-fill)
- **Interactive exploratory analysis** (price series, log returns distribution, VWAP, rolling volatility)

The tool is intentionally designed to be **simple, robust, and production-like**, mirroring real internal tools used at quantitative trading firms (e.g., supporting ad-hoc research tasks with clean, readable Python code).

It directly demonstrates proficiency in:
- Python (clean, modular code)
- Pandas & NumPy (core data manipulation)
- Streamlit (interactive web apps for internal use)
- Quantitative data handling (realistic synthetic tick data with intentional noise)
